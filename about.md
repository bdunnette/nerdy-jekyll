**NERDY was organized to represent the recreational interests of families and children living in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota to educate and train children ages 7‚Äê17 in the sport of roller derby.**

+ We inspire all youth to play at a highly athletic level within a team environment focusing on mutual respect, athleticism, and empowerment.
+ We provide youth with the skills necessary to embody responsibly and accountability to enable themselves and other members of the community to foster inclusion and acceptance of all individuals by promoting the uniqueness of each individual.
+ We provide youth with the skills, knowledge, and tools to meet or exceed the requirements of the governing body of the Junior Roller Derby Association ([JRDA](http://www.juniorrollerderby.org/)).
+ We support the Twin Cites Metro area community by providing cross-generational learning opportunities and to promote stewardship of roller derby through a variety of low-cost recreational opportunities.
+ We support services to families with the opportunities for all youth to participate, regardless of barriers.
